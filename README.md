<!--## - From The Stars - -->
## - Deeper in my mind -

> *Try the game [here](https://sobriket.itch.io/dimm)*

This game has been made for the CreaJam 2024 on Unity. 
The theme was "Deeper and Deeper" with an optional constraint "Black & White".

It's an endless runner in first person view,
you're playing in a bicolor environment where you have to dodge donuts,
crystals, fans and brick walls. Your goal is to go the furthest possible.
